# wifi_iot_framework
Basic framework for DIY IoT devices based on ESP8266.  Includes persistant WIFI config, and fallback to an AP with a captive portal (WiFIManager), OTA updates (ArduinoOTA), and basic MQTT config (ASyncMQTTClient)

With the end goal of being able to crank out tons of cheap devices using NodeMCU boards or even ESP-01s for a variety of purposes (relays, sensors, solenoid valves for the garden, etc, etc, etc).
